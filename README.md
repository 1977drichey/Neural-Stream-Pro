3. Each Pi auto-registers with main go2rtc server
4. Access all streams via main interface at 192.168.50.93:8971

### Performance Tuning
```bash
# Check optimization status
/opt/neural-stream/scripts/status.sh

# Monitor real-time performance
htop  # CPU usage
iotop # Disk I/O
vcgencmd measure_temp  # Temperature

# View streaming efficiency
journalctl -u neural-stream -f
```

### Main go2rtc Integration
Your Pi automatically registers as:
- Stream name: `neural_pi_YOUR_IP`
- Available in Frigate at: http://192.168.50.93:8971
- TCP source: `tcp://YOUR_PI_IP:8888`

## GUI Configuration

### Config Tab Features
- **🌐 Main go2rtc Server**: Connect to your Frigate setup
- **☁️ Cloud Storage**: Full rclone integration with test functionality  
- **🔐 Security Settings**: Change passwords, SSH control

- **Local Storage**: Auto-cleanup with configurable retention

## Troubleshooting

### Temperature Management
```bash
# Check current temperature
vcgencmd measure_temp

# View thermal history
journalctl -u neural-stream | grep -i temperature

# Add cooling if consistently >65°C
# - Small heatsink on SoC
# - Case with ventilation
# - Lower quality in Config tab
```

### Stream Quality Issues
```bash
# Test camera directly
libcamera-hello --list-cameras
libcamera-vid -t 5000 --save-pts test.h264

# Check optimized streaming
/opt/neural-stream/scripts/optimized_camera_stream.sh 720p

# Monitor CPU usage during streaming  
top -p $(pgrep libcamera-vid)
```

### Cloud Sync Problems
```bash
# Test rclone configuration
rclone lsd YOUR_REMOTE:

# Check sync logs
tail -f /var/log/neural-stream/cloud-sync.log

# Manual sync test
/opt/neural-stream/scripts/cloud_sync.sh gdrive:neural-stream recordings false
```

### Network Discovery Issues
```bash
# Check network connectivity
ping 192.168.50.93

# Test main go2rtc connection
curl http://192.168.50.93:1984/api/streams

# Verify nginx is running
systemctl status nginx
netstat -tlnp | grep :443
```
